				<h4>
					Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight
					columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares.
					The colors of the sixty-four squares alternate between light and dark, and are referred to as "light squares" and "dark squares".
					The chessboard is placed so that each player has a white square in the near right hand corner,
					and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram, with each queen on a square that matches its color.
				</h4>
				<h4>
					Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: each player's pieces comprise one king,
					one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. One player, referred to as
					White, controls the white pieces and the other player, Black, controls the black pieces; White is always the first player to move.
					The colors are chosen either by a friendly agreement, by a game of chance or by a tournament director.
					The players alternate moving one piece at a time (with the exception of <a href="#castling">castling</a>, when two pieces are moved at the same time).
					Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square, or one occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it and removing it from play.
					With one exception <a href="#passant">(en passant)</a>, all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.

			<h2 class="headline">King</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
					A special move with the king known as <a href="#castling">castling</a> is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
				</h4>
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="headline">Rook</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					The rook moves any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally
					(it is also involved in the king's special move of <a href="#castling">castling</a>).
				</h4>
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="headline">Bishop</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					The bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any direction diagonally.
					Note that a bishop never changes square color, therefore players speak about "light-squared" or "dark-squared" bishops.
				</h4>
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="headline">Queen</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.
				</h4>
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="headline">Knight</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					The knight can jump over occupied squares and moves two spaces horizontally and one space
					vertically or vice versa, making an "L" shape. A knight in the middle of the board has eight
					squares to which it can move. Note that every time a knight moves, it changes square color.
				</h4>
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="headline">Pawn</h2>
			<div class="well">
				<h4>
					A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved,
					a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are
					vacant. Pawns cannot move backward
				</h4>
				<h4>
					Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture
					an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).

					Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on
					the other side of the king, adjacent to it. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved.</h4></li>
					<li><h4>There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.</h4></li>
					<li><h4>The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under
							attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square).</h4></li>

				<h4>
					If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to
					a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen).
					The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a
					player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted.
					If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece.
